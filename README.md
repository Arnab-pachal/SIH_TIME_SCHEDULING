## 🚀 Revolutionary AI-Based Timetable Generation System

This **AI-powered timetable generation system** delivers an automated solution for complex, multidisciplinary scheduling aligned with **India's National Education Policy (NEP) 2020**. Our genetic algorithm core efficiently searches for optimal timetables while a React-based dashboard provides real-time visualization and editing capabilities.
